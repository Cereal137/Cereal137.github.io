Great to see you here in github, from which you can see all the contents that has been presented on my website cereal137.github.io
I am still at the very beginning period of learning how to build a website, so there may constantly be some errors when I am trying to update my websites.
In my point of view, updating a completely self-built website is a tedious work, especially I am now a freshman at Peking University.
Right now I am still learning how to code with HTML, but by mimicking several models on Adobe DreamWeaver I can now design my own website simply by coding!
If you are interested in building your own Website but have no idea how to start with, feel free to contact me!
I will leave my email address inside the website. It has always been a pleasure to lend a hand to the other, especially someone with the same interests!
