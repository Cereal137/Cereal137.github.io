    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">This is a totally self-built website based on github. I am trying to upload something interesting about my college life during my four year in Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University. There will definitely be a lot of useless but funny things associating various respective fields. What I am trying to illustrate through this website is that I have a wide range of interests and am capable of making everything I love and dream about into reality. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> At the very first begining I am learning how to code with HTML, from which I suffered a lot. There are so many tedious works to do to finally present you with the web page now you are surfing. At this period I am not going to do something fancy to decorate my website, I just wanna make sure it works well and all of my viewers can have a clear and quick access to anything that I shared.</p>
    <p class="text_column">I will post series of blogs in this period of time. Do not be too skeptical about the content, because what I endeavor to do is to just present the real version of me and the real life I experienced during my college life. Apparently I have finished some blogs in the past few months based on Hexo NEXT, and I am always delighted to show you what I have learned in the past. So you can easily find my previous blogs below. Recently I have been working with Video shooting which interests me a lot since I first subscribed Casey Neistat on his youtube channel just a few days ago. Hope you can see my progress on it very soon!</p>
